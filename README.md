# Parrot: Peptide Sequence Classification 
Parrot is a machine learning pipeline designed for classifying peptide sequences. Leveraging one-hot encoding and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture, this project processes amino acid sequences to predict their activity, making it a valuable tool for bioinformatics and computational biology applications.
